
## Updating
To update the slideshow with new entries, we first need to clone and pull this repo (do this however is the most comfortable for you, I recommend Github Desktop personally, see photo for how to clone this with Desktop).

Next, you'll need to have Python 3 installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Any recent version of Python 3 should be fine, but for context, the project was built using 3.15.5.

### Add Entries
To add an entry, open up NewEntries.csv (Excel is the easiest for this). The file should be a mostly blank with only the following headers:

| Project Title | Author | Image File | Tool Badge 1 | Tool Badge 2 | Tool Badge 3 | Tool Badge 4 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
